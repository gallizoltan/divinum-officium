!Wis 5:1
v. Then shall the just stand with great constancy against those that have afflicted them, and taken away their labours.
$Deo gratias

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. While Christ's disciples, grieving, sad,
Their master's painful death deplore,
Whom faithless servants' cruel hands,
Had bathed in his own crimson gore;
_
Quick from the happy realms above,
An angel comes on joyful wing,
And to the women tells the joy
That to his flock their Lord will bring.
_
As they with eager steps make haste,
Their joyous message to repeat,
Their master's glorious form they see,
And falling clasp his sacred feet.
_
Cheered by this tale, his faithful flock
The Galilean mount ascend,
And there with loving awe behold
Their heart's sole wish, their truest friend.
_
That thou mayst be our Paschal joy
Through happy, never-ending years,
thine own poor children, Jesu, free
From sin's sad death with all its fears.
_
* To God the Father, and the Son,
Who rose from death, glad praise repeat;
Let equal praise be ever sung
To God the Holy Paraclete.
Amen.

And, wondering, faithful witness bear,
And all that they have seen declare.

Possess our inmost hearts today,
While grateful lips with glad acclaim
Sing fervent praises to thy name.

Our Easter joy eternally,
Our souls from death of sin set free
That they, new born, may live to thee.

From death arisen, praise be done:
With God the Holy Ghost on high
Henceforth to all eternity.

In loud accord both far and nigh
The Lord's arising testify.

Do Thou our hearts and souls possess;
To Thee our praise that we may pay,
To Whom our praise is due for aye.

In this our Paschal joy, protect
From all that death would fain effect
Thy ransomed flock, Thine own elect.
